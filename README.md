# Real-Time Object Detection
Real-time object detection project using **OpenCV** and **YOLOv3**.

# Introduction
Real-time object detection and classification using OpencV library and YOLOv3 pre-trained weights. It detects 90 different objects and gives the output in *Turkish*. It prints the object names and predicted confidence values for each object using your cameragit . 

# Installation
- **Check Python Version**
`python -V`
`python3 -V`
- **Install Pip**
`sudo apt install python-pip`
`sudo apt install python3-pip`
- **Install NumPy**
`pip install numpy`
`pip3 install numpy`
- **Install OpenCV**
`pip install opencv-python`
`pip install opencv-python3`
- **YOLOv3**: Download the pre-trained YOLOv3 weights and config files from this repo and place it with the same directory or you can directly download from the [YOLO website](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/).
